# CharliesAngels
## Welcome to our first expirement with [SCRUM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) at [CodeCool](https://www.codecool.com/)!

### Short Description:
Blood Donation Register program in Charlie's Angels (no 3) team in CodeCool Msc-2015

### Long Description:

Our mentors at CodeCool decided to give us a big project which can help us practicing scrum. This is a database manager software for blood donations. There were ca. 10 scrum groups working separately from each other. We have chosen the name "Charlie's Angels" for our group, that's what the name of this repository comes from.

There were 4 [sprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(software_development))s, each of them took one week (5 days).
Here are the task descriptions of these [sprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(software_development))s and also the descriptions of our solutions with our conclusions:
* [General](TaskDescription/InitialOrder.md)
* [Week5](TaskDescription/OrdersWeek5.md)
* [Week6](TaskDescription/OrdersWeek6.md)
* [Week7](TaskDescription/OrdersWeek7.md)
