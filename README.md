# CharliesAngels
## Welcome to our first expirement with scrum at CodeCool!

### Short Description:
Blood Donation Register program in Charlie's Angels (no 3) team in CodeCool Msc-2015

### Long Description:

Our mentors at CodeCool decided to give us a big project which can help us practicing scrum. This is a database manager software for blood donations. There were ca. 10 scrum groups working separately from each other. We have chosen the name "Charlie's Angels" for our group, that's what the name of this repository comes from.
